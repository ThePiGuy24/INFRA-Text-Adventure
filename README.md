# INFRA Text Adventure

This is mainly a project to see how well INFRA would work if it was a text anventure.
Development will most likely be rather slow as I dont have much free time to work on it because of school and sleep.

## Notes to editors
How the thing works:
* `Levels/start.json` defines where the adventure starts, for example
  ```json
  {
	"file": "office",
	"position": 0
  }
  ``` 
  will mean that the game will start in the level `office`, at position `0`.
